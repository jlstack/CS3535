#Problem

I want to cluster all of the beats in a given song.

#Questions

1. How do you cluster beats in a song?
2. Could you replace a beat with a different beat in it's cluster while maintaining the overall sound of the piece?
3. Does the number of clusters change with different genres and/or artists?
