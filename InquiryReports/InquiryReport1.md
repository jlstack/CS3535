#Problem

I want to cluster all of the beats in a given song.

#Questions

1. How do you cluster beats in a song?
2. Could you replace a beat with a different beat in it's cluster while maintaining the overall sound of the piece?
3. Does the number of clusters change with different genres and/or artists?

#Resources

1. [Programming Collective Intelligence]
2. [The Beatles Genome Project: Cluster Analysis and Visualization of Popular Music]
3. [Million Song Dataset]

### 1. Mini-abstract and relevance of [Programming Collective Intelligence]

Programming Collective Intelligence is a book on processing data using Python. It has multiple chapters on different clustering algorithms that I would like to implement for this project. The two specific algorithms I would like to work with are [Hierarchical Clustering] and [K-Means Clustering]. This resource helps me answer question 1.

### 2. Mini-abstract and relevance of [CLUSTERING BEAT-CHROMA PATTERNS IN A LARGE MUSIC DATABASE]

In this research paper, Douglas J. Mason applies [Hierarchical Clustering] " to show statistical phenomena occuring in a corpus of popular songs written by the Beatles." This is similar to what I want to be able to do. I just want to do it according to indivual beats across multiple genres and artists.

### 3. Mini-abstract and relevance of [Million Song Dataset]

The Million Song Dataset provides the [The Echo Nest] analysis for hundreds of thousands of songs. I hope to use this data to answer question 3 once I implement my clustering algorithm.
